-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
new features

matchit
- spatial input option handling and verification
- spatial nearest neighbor matching
    + spatial caliper & distance decay functions

- calrandom option (matchit2nearest): [default=FALSE] when set to FALSE, disables random sampling from control pool when using caliper (picks nearest instead)
- static.selection option: [default=FALSE] when set to TRUE, removes certain random sampling options (picks first in list instead). useful for replicating results during testing (currently only used in matchit2nearest)

demo
- spatial demo
- spatial proof of concept


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
general improvements

- improved code styling (spacing, indentation, line length, loop/conditional format)
- improved various variable names for clarity
- added comments
- refactored a bunch of matchit2nearest
- added a warning in matchit2nearest that provides number of treated units not matched due to caliper

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
bugs

- FIXED: in nearest matching when using caliper and calclosest and pool == 0, it was including discarded control units in list of possible matches


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
issues

- no real information is returned if matching fails due to no enough matches
- calclosest option description could be improved a bit, maybe with a simple example and someting regarding the implications of using this

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
todo

- spatial documentation
- add spatial functionality to remaining matching options
- improve spatial demo / proof of concept
