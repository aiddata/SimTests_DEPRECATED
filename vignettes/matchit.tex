\section{\texttt{matchit()}: Implementation of Matching Methods}
\label{sec:matchit}
Use \texttt{matchit()} to implement a variety of matching procedures
including exact matching, nearest neighbor matching,
subclassification, optimal matching, genetic matching, and full
matching.  The output of {\tt matchit()} can be analyzed via any
standard R package, by exporting the data for use in another program,
or most simply via \hlink{Zelig}{http://gking.harvard.edu/zelig} in R.
