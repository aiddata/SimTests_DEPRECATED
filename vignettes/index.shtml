      <td valign="top"><br>MatchIt implements the suggestions of <a
      href="http://gking.harvard.edu/files/abs/matchp-abs.shtml">Ho, Imai, King, and Stuart
      (2007)</a> for improving parametric statistical
      models by
      preprocessing data with nonparametric matching methods. MatchIt
      implements a wide range of sophisticated matching methods,
      making it possible to greatly reduce the dependence of causal
      inferences on hard-to-justify, but commonly made, statistical
      modeling assumptions. The software also easily fits into
      existing research practices since, after preprocessing data with
      MatchIt, researchers can use whatever parametric model they
      would have used without MatchIt, but produce inferences with
      substantially more robustness and less sensitivity to modeling
      assumptions. MatchIt is an <a
      href="http://www.r-project.org" target="gkingext">R</a> program, and also works
      seamlessly with <a href="http://gking.harvard.edu/zelig/">Zelig</a>.

We're pleased to report that the <a
href="http://gking.harvard.edu/files/abs/matchp-abs.shtml">article</a> on which MatchIt is
based won the <em>Warren Miller Prize</em> for the best paper in
<em>Political Analysis</em> that year and, separately, has been named a
    <em>Fast Breaking Paper</em> by Thomson Reuters' ScienceWatch, for
    being the article with the largest
    percentage increase in citations among those in the top 1% of
    total citations across the social sciences in the last two years.
